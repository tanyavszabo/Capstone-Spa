  <h1 class="about-h1">ABOUT</h1><p>When you are offered an opportunity that could be “Your Next Big
                Break”, you take it. That is how I found myself on a one-way
                flight to Mexico, with a 50lbs duffle and a pair of high heels.
                I was offered a contract to model in Mexico for the summer and
                was determined to make a small splash in the fashion world. I
                returned home with a few paid-for photos and a low balance. I
                quickly learned that chances are paid for, unless you know
                somebody who knows somebody. In the world of social media,
                combined with the drive to create, networking should be simple.
                However, beauty also attracts predators who spoil the art,
                adding to the never-ending list of modeling war stories. Every
                story had the same theme: Lack of affordability, the need for
                experience, and the desire to establish a connection caused
                creatives to compromise their safety. I want to build an
                application that will be a major platform for creatives of all
                experience levels to network and collaborate. A lot of
                individuals either have talents that go unnoticed or potential
                that never gets discovered. Starting out in the fashion industry
                is challenging because it is expensive and requires experience.
                Along with financial dependency and prerequisites, it is easy
                for beginners to be taken advantage of or placed in unsafe
                situations while searching for opportunities. My application is
                called “Cobalt”- Create. Collab. Connect. The purpose of Cobalt
                is to create a safe network of creatives (which include
                photographers, models, fashion stylists, hair stylists, makeup
                artists, and videographers) to collaborate with each other,
                based on selected locations, for free. Cobalt connects members
                of the fashion industry by allowing users to post Time for Photo
                Job requests that provide opportunities for artists. This allows
                each party to mutually benefit by exchanging skills, gaining
                experience, and adding to their portfolios. Currently, safety
                isn't prioritized in most platforms' creative use. I plan to
                prioritize safety by implementing security features such as
                profile verification and account approval.</p></div>
